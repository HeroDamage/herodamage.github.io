    <p>Dear friends of Hero Damage,</p>
    <p>We have decided to stop publishing simulation resources for World of Warcraft and focus on a different kind of Theorycrafting and research.
      Since we are all fans of the amazing strategy game Minesweeper, we will dedicate this site to all Theorycrafting related to the game.

            to give you everything you need in order to become one of the best competitive Minesweeper players. You want those Mythic Minesweep parses and
            your gray rankings and early explosions do not satisfy you? Then you have come to the right place.</p></td>
