  <strong>Another important note for Assassination Rogues!</strong><br><br>
  There is currently a bug affecting Deadly Poison and Nightstalker that you can abuse to gain more dps, more info <a href="/rogue/dpgate.html" title="How to see the impact of Deadly Poison bug on SimC">here</a>.<br><br>
  Be careful about bug abuse, even if it's not a big one it still remains a bug abuse, you're warned.

  <strong>Important note for Assassination Rogues!</strong><br><br>
  With enough Mastery or Poison Knives relics, dropping Mutilate and using Fan of Knives as the main generator actually becomes an increase. If you see variations including "FoK" for Combinations or Relics, those are profiles using Fan of Knives instead of Mutilate.<br><br>
  To sim yourself and check whether using FoK is an increase, you can copy and paste <a href="/rogue/fokstring.html" title="How to enabled Fan of Knives rotation on SimC">this code</a> after your /simc output. E.g. on Raidbots, open "Advanced", insert your /simc Addon output and then, right after, the code from the link.<br><br>
  Be careful about changing your gear too much, it's not unlikely that this will be hotfixed.
