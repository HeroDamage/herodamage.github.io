<div class="alert alert-warning">
  <strong>Important note for Assassination Rogues!</strong> With enough Mastery or Poison Knives relics, dropping Mutilate and using Fan of Knives as the main generator actually becomes an increase. If you see variations including "FoK" for Combinations or Relics, those are profiles using Fan of Knives instead of Mutilate.<br><br>
  To sim yourself and check whether using FoK is an increase, you can copy and paste <a href="/rogue/fokstring.html">this code</a> after your /simc output. E.g. on Raidbots, open "Advanced", insert your /simc Addon output and then, right after, the code from the link.<br><br>
  Be careful about changing your gear too much, it's not unlikely that this will be hotfixed.
