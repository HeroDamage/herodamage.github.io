Frequently Asked Question
=========================


<ul>
  <li>
    <h3>What is the purpose of this website?</h3>
    <p>
      The purpose of this website is to provide a centralized base of theorycrafting for all World of Warcraft classes.<br>
      Our goal is to make accessible all the tools you need to optimize your character, with a clear and simple website.
    </p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <h3>Who is it intended for?</h3>
    <p>This site is intended for all players who wants to learn more about the optimization of their characters.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <h3>How are these results generated ?</h3>
    <p>These results are generated using SimulationCraft, by combining several profiles to obtain an overall view of the specialization concerned.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <h3>How to see the gear of the combinator?</h3>
    <p>It's not possible to fully see it yet, but it will be soon !</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <h3>With which T2 of the Netherlight Crucible is sim the Crucible ring ?</h3>
    <p>The profiles of the specialization are all simmmed with Torment the Weak, so the T2 used for the Crucible ring is Torment the Weak. Because of this, if you don't have 3 Torment the Weak, it's highly advisable to sim your own character with the Crucible ring.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <h3>Can I compare my character to the combinator?</h3>
    <p>Your character has different gear than the combinator (mythic +, warforged / titanforged, ...). The combinator, has only the gear of its tier and without wf/tf. It's highly advised to sim your own character to find the best possible setup. </p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <h3>But if I have to sim my character in any case, the combinator doesn't help ?</h3>
    <p>The main goal of the combinator is to highlight outliers and also to get an idea of the set, so you can test the best combination with your own character, even if the combinator has a different gear than yours, the best combination is often the right one !</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <h3>Does the combinator represent the specific raid conditions?</h3>
    <p>
    Not really at this moment, it's a single target patchwerk simulation, without x players with you.<br>
    Also, the 100 > 90% phase of the boss might be longer making some legendary like Cinidaria or talents that work well above 80% hp overrated.<br>
    This reasoning does apply for the execute phase, there is no ideal solution to this.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <h3>How are the trinket sim?</h3>
    <p>Only one trinket is simmed, so some combinations that make a strong trinket with another aren't taken account, the option will be added in the future.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <h3>Where can I find the SimC profiles that are used for the website?</h3>
    <p>We are almost always using default Simulationcraft profiles.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <h3>How to read the relics graph?</h3>
    <p>With the indicator of the ilvl of the weapon on the first line, you can know how much ilvl equals your trait.<br>
    Moreover by hovering it you can know the exact dps gain.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <h3>Are pantheon trinkets proc triggered?</h3>
    <p>They are not except in the Trinkets simulation where there is the "x-Pantheon" suffix.</p>
  </li>
